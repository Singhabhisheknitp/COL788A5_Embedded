# COL788A5_Embedded

1. I have adopted pairwise file configuation for code generation in STM32, hence you would find differnt source file for i2c, uart, freertos and not in main, This is to just improve the readability of code
2. I have compiled all the issues faced during assignment in COL788A5.pdf, there were so many bugs I noticed while doing it and I keep noting all the issues. 
However the major problem I faced was, the FREERTOS tasks getting halted in deadlock. This I could not resolved but I have shared my fincdings with the TA. 
3. In addition to that, I have included Setup.jpeg. The handwritten connection diagram I have uploaded in seprate file circuit.jpeg
